# Weather-App
This project is a simple weather application that allows users to search for the current weather conditions of any city. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data and display it in a user-friendly interface. The app shows the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions through icons and text.
